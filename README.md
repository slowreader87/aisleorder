# Aisle Order #

This app allows you to create a shopping list which is ordered by category (or aisle if dealing with a supermarket). Although the buttons are hard-coded for my use they can be easily changed for yours.

## A note on Coding ##

As you will probably see straight away from the code this is actually my first functional app so there's plenty wrong with it. First it's single user so no login required. It's also not been split out into components the way it should have been. I will do this in a later version as a learning exercise.

### Get in touch ###

If you like the concept presented in this app please get in touch. I'm always looking to meet other developers especially those i can bounce ideas off and learn from. This is just a hobby for me but i hope one day it can be more.

Enjoy using Aisle Order!
